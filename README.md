# RedditBot!!!
This was a bot I made for a server w/ my friends rahhhh

## What does it do?
Goofy things. It literally does goofy things. 

## Reddit?!
Major feature, along with annoying people (I still have to get past the block feature on Discord sadly), is that it can access any subreddit and look at posts on there, and even sort

(Except the nsfw ones you nasty individuals)

## Other features
Look in the code! Method names are quite accurate if I do say so myself

## Future plans?
None, the friend group lwk collapsed and the server is now basically unused lol ðŸ’€

## Why is this going on github?
In case a recruiter tries stalking me (in which case pls hire trust im efficient worker and very funny and handsome) ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­

Nah jokes. If I'm being for real, I'd say that I'm a worker that thrives under pressure blah blah blah and I am really good at coding and love learning new things and going out of my comfort zone. Adding a bunch of stuff to GitHub around the same time even though I made them a long time ago just to showcase my projects (should've done this earlier not gonna lie)

## Other notes

If you want to use this bot for your server, feel free to! Also text me if you have any questions :)
